## Overview & Mission

The mental health of college students is a growing concern, yet access to support is often hindered by stigma, cost, and availability. Maanam aims to bridge this gap by providing a suite of digital tools that are accessible, confidential, and culturally relevant. Our mission is to empower students with first-line psychological support and provide institutions with the anonymous, aggregated data needed to create healthier campus environments.

## Core Features

This MVP showcases the foundational pillars of the Maanam platform:

* **üîê Secure User Authentication:** Standard email/password registration and login system using JWT for secure session management.
* **üß† AI-Powered First-Aid Chat:**
    * An interactive chat assistant built on a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model.
    * Provides evidence-based coping strategies (e.g., CBT, mindfulness) in a conversational format.
    * Includes a **non-skippable crisis escalation protocol** that detects high-risk language and immediately presents emergency resources.
* **üìä Anonymous Self-Assessments:**
    * Validated screening tools like **GAD-7 (for Anxiety)** and **PHQ-9 (for Depression)**.
    * User scores are **never linked to their identity**. Results are immediately anonymized and aggregated to protect privacy while powering the admin dashboard.
* **üìö Psychoeducational Resource Hub:** A curated library of articles, videos, and audio guides on topics relevant to students, such as academic stress, anxiety, and building healthy habits.
* **üìà Admin Dashboard (Mockup):** A high-fidelity mockup demonstrating how institutions can view anonymized, aggregated well-being trends (e.g., "What percentage of students are reporting moderate anxiety this month?"). This feature is designed for data-driven policy making, **not** student surveillance.

## Guiding Principles

Our development is guided by a strong ethical framework:

1.  **Privacy-First by Design:** We physically separate user identity from sensitive data like assessment scores. It is technically impossible to trace an aggregated data point back to an individual user.
2.  **Ethical AI & User Safety:** The AI assistant is a supportive tool, not a therapist. Its primary function is to offer safe, evidence-based first aid and recognize its limitations by escalating crisis situations to real-world help.
3.  **Data-Driven, Not Data-Intrusive:** We believe in using data for good. The platform provides institutions with high-level insights to improve support systems, without compromising the privacy of the individuals they serve.

## Live Demo

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18.x or later)
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (or npm/yarn)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) database instance

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/v0-mental-health-system-mvp.git](https://github.com/your-username/v0-mental-health-system-mvp.git)
    cd v0-mental-health-system-mvp
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following variables.

    ```env
    # Database Connection
    POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"

    # JWT Secret for Authentication
    JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-key-that-is-at-least-32-characters-long"

    # LLM API Key (e.g., OpenAI)
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your-llm-api-key"
    ```

### Database Setup

The `scripts/schema.sql` file contains the necessary SQL commands to create the tables. You can execute this file against your PostgreSQL database using a tool like `psql` or a GUI client.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

2.  **Open your browser:**
    Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application running.

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized to maintain a clean separation of concerns.
